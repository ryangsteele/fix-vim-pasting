# fix-vim-pasting
Because it should work.

Allows you to paste indented content into a file from your terminal without explicitly turning paste mode on/off to prevent vim's auto-indenting from mangling your code - it is now handled automatically for you!

Say goodbye to the arduous process of "toggle paste mode on, enter insert mode, paste content, exit insert mode, toggle paste mode off", and bid farewell to all those times when you realized none of your mappings were working because you forgot to `:set nopaste`!
